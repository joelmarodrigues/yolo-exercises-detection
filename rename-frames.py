# This step is not this relevant, but it's useful to keep the frames organized.
# In order to train the model I need to have a lot of images of a person doing the squat exercise in diferent angles and positions.
# This way I can train the model to recognize the squat exercise in a more general way.
# To avoid collecting the images manually, I can use the frames extracted from the videos.

# This snippet renames the frames in a folder with the format: {video_folder}_{frame}.jpg.
# I made the mistake and this code helped me to fix it.
# DO NOT USE THIS CODE IF YOU DON'T NEED TO RENAME THE FRAMES.
