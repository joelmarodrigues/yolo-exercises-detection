# YOLOv8 Exercise Detection

This project focuses on detecting exercise movements using YOLOv8. Currently, the model is trained to recognize different squat positions.

## üìä First Model Results

The first model was trained with **50 epochs**, and its performance was evaluated using key YOLO metrics:

![First Model Detection](processing/1-model-trained.jpg)

- **mAP50:** 0.929 (overall)
- **mAP50-95:** 0.752 (overall)
- **Class-wise mAP50:**
  - Half-Squat: 0.83
  - Squat: 0.962
  - Standing: 0.995

The model performed well in detecting different squat positions but showed inconsistencies in distinguishing between similar postures like half-squat and standing.

## üìä Second Model Results

After refining the dataset and increasing training to **100 epochs**, the second model showed improvements in some areas but challenges remained:

![Second Model Detection](processing/2-model-trained.jpg)

- **mAP50:** 0.814 (slight decrease)
- **mAP50-95:** 0.376 (decrease)
- **Class-wise mAP50:**
  - Half-Squat: 0.753
  - Squat: 0.995
  - Standing: 0.695

While the squat detection remained strong (mAP50: **0.995**), half-squat recognition slightly declined. The dataset size and diversity might need further adjustments.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Future Improvements
- Currently, the model only detects squats.
- Class differentiation (e.g., half-squat vs. standing) still needs refinement.
- Future versions will include additional exercises and improved data augmentation.
